# Voice-Controlled-Speech-Recognition-Processing-System
This project explores MATLAB's capabilities in audio processing and speech recognition by developing a voice-controlled system. It enhanced my skills in MATLAB programming, audio signal handling, and integrating models like wav2vec2, while improving my problem-solving and software integration abilities.
